# Part A — Create a free Atlassian / Jira account

1. **Open the Jira signup page.**
   Go to Atlassian’s Cloud signup (the “Get started / Try Jira” page). This is the official place to create a free Jira account. ([Atlassian][1])

2. **Choose how to sign up.**
   You can sign up with a work email (recommended) or use Google / Microsoft / Apple / Slack single-sign-on. Enter your email and follow the prompts. (Atlassian encourages using a work email to help find teammates.) ([Atlassian][1])

3. **Verify your email.**
   Atlassian will send a verification email — click the verification link in that message to confirm your account. If you don’t see it, check spam. ([Atlassian Support][2])

4. **Pick products and finish setup.**
   After verification, you’ll be prompted to pick products (choose **Jira Software**). The free tier is available and doesn’t require a credit card — it supports up to 10 users and includes basic storage & community support. ([Atlassian][3])

5. **Sign in to your new Jira Cloud site.**
   You’ll get a site like `your-team.atlassian.net` — sign in and you’ll arrive at the Jira dashboard.

# Part B — Create a Scrum project named **Ratnakar Agile Works**

> **Tip:** For small/independent teams or easiest setup, use a **Team-managed (Next-gen)** Scrum project. If your company uses centralized admin controls and needs shared schemes, pick **Company-managed**. Team-managed is simpler for self-configuration. ([Atlassian Support][4])

1. **Open “Create project”.**
   From the Jira top navigation, click **Projects → Create project** (or the big “Create project” button on your dashboard). ([Atlassian Support][5])

2. **Choose the project type / template.**

    * In the modal, select **Software** (if shown) and then choose the **Scrum** template (you can preview it).
    * If prompted, choose **Team-managed** (recommended for quick, independent setup) or **Company-managed** if your org requires that. ([Atlassian][6])

3. **Name the project.**
   In the “Project name” field type:

   ```
   Ratnakar Agile Works
   ```

   Jira will suggest a **Project key** (usually an uppercase short code). You can accept or edit it (e.g., `RAW` or `RATNAKAR`). The project key becomes issue prefixes (e.g., `RAW-1`). ([Atlassian Support][5])

4. **Confirm and create.**
   Click **Create** (or **Create project**). Jira will create the project and open its Scrum board and backlog for you.

5. **Verify the project layout (Backlog & Board).**
   Your new Scrum project will have a **Backlog** (where you add and prioritize issues), a **Board** (visual sprint board), and planning tools like sprints and reports. If a board isn’t visible, you can create one and base it on the project (Create → Board → Create a Scrum board). ([Atlassian Support][7])

# Quick next steps inside the new project (short checklist)

* **Add issues (stories/tasks):** Backlog → Create issue.
* **Create an Epic(s):** Use “Create” and set issue type = Epic.
* **Create a Sprint:** In Backlog, click **Create sprint**, drag issues into it, then **Start sprint**.
* **Invite teammates:** Use the top-right **Invite** or project **People** settings and add their emails. (Free plan allows up to 10 users.) ([Atlassian][3])

# Handy tips & troubleshooting

* **Can’t see “Create project”?** You might lack permissions for company-managed projects — try creating a **team-managed** project (any user can create team-managed projects) or ask your Jira admin. ([Atlassian Support][5])
* **Project type choice:** If you’re just starting, **team-managed Scrum** is easiest; choose **company-managed** only if you need standardized workflows or admin-level controls. ([Atlassian Support][4])
* **Free plan limits:** Free tier supports up to **10 users**, limited storage (2 GB), and community support. If you expect a larger team or need advanced features, consider upgrading later. ([Atlassian][3])
* **If invited teammates don’t get mail:** Ask them to check spam and verify their Atlassian account; you can resend invites from Project → People. ([Atlassian Support][2])
